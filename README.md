# Sample README

Open with intent - we welcome contributions - we want pull requests and to hear about issues.

## Who is this for?

The README should be addressed to somebody who's never seen this before.
But also don't assume that they're a novice.

### Code user

Does this repo publish to pub.dev or similar? In which case the code user just needs a pointer there.

### Contributor

This is the person who we want working with us here.
CONTRIBUTING.md is going to have the detailed guidance on how to setup their tools,
tests and how to make a pull request.
